The admin site is ugly!  How can I change it?
---------------------------------------------

We think it's very purty, but if you don't agree you can modify the admin site's
presentation by editing the CSS stylesheet and/or associated image files.  The 
site is built using semantic HTML, so any changes you'd like to make should be
possible by editing the CSS stylesheet.  We've got a `guide to the CSS used 
in the admin`_ to get you started.

How do you pronounce "Django"?
------------------------------

According to Wikipedia_, "Django is pronounced **zhane**-go (with a long 'a')."

Is Django stable?
-----------------

We've been using Django for almost two years.  Sites built on Django have
weathered traffic spikes of over one million hits an hour, and at least
one slashdotting.  Yes; it's quite stable.
