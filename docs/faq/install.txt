FAQ: Installation
=================

How do I get started?
---------------------

    #. `Download the code`_.
    #. Install Django (read the :ref:`installation guide <intro-install>`).
    #. Walk through the :ref:`tutorial <intro-tutorial01>`.
    #. Check out the rest of the :ref:`documentation <index>`, and `ask questions`_ if you
       run into trouble.

How do I fix the "install a later version of setuptools" error?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Just run the ``ez_setup.py`` script in the Django distribution.

What are Django's prerequisites?
--------------------------------

Django requires Python_ 2.3 or later. No other Python libraries are required
for basic Django usage.

For a development environment -- if you just want to experiment with Django --
you don't need to have a separate Web server installed; Django comes with its
own lightweight development server. For a production environment, we recommend
`Apache 2`_ and mod_python_, although Django follows the WSGI_ spec, which
means it can run on a variety of server platforms.

If you want to use Django with a database, which is probably the case, you'll
also need a database engine. PostgreSQL_ is recommended, because we're
PostgreSQL fans, and MySQL_, `SQLite 3`_, and Oracle_ are also supported.

Do I lose anything by using Python 2.3 versus newer Python versions, such as Python 2.5?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, not in the core framework. Django itself is guaranteed to work with any
version of Python from 2.3 and higher. However, some "django.contrib" add-on 
components may require a more recent Python release.  The django.contrib.gis
component, for example, requires Python 2.4.

If you use a Python version newer than 2.3, you will, of course, be able to
take advantage of newer Python features in your own code, along with the speed
improvements and other optimizations that have been made to the Python language
itself. But the Django framework itself should work equally well on 2.3 as it
does on 2.4 or 2.5.

Do I have to use mod_python?
----------------------------

Although we recommend mod_python for production use, you don't have to use it,
thanks to the fact that Django uses an arrangement called WSGI_. Django can
talk to any WSGI-enabled server. Other non-mod_python deployment setups are
FastCGI, SCGI or AJP. See
:ref:`How to use Django with FastCGI, SCGI or AJP <howto-deployment-fastcgi>`
for full information.

Also, see the `server arrangements wiki page`_ for other deployment strategies.

If you just want to play around and develop things on your local computer, use
the development Web server that comes with Django. Things should Just Work.

How do I install mod_python on Windows?
---------------------------------------

    * For Python 2.4, grab mod_python from `win32 build of mod_python for
      Python 2.4`_.
    * For Python 2.4, check out this `Django on Windows howto`_.
    * For Python 2.3, grab mod_python from http://www.modpython.org/ and read
      `Running mod_python on Apache on Windows2000`_.
    * Also, try this (not Windows-specific) `guide to getting mod_python
      working`_.

Will Django run under shared hosting (like TextDrive or Dreamhost)?

Should I use the official version or development version?
---------------------------------------------------------

The Django developers improve Django every day and are pretty good about not
checking in broken code. We use the development code (from the Subversion
repository) directly on our servers, so we consider it stable. With that in
mind, we recommend that you use the latest development code, because it
generally contains more features and fewer bugs than the "official" releases.
