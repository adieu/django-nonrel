The flatpages app
=================

Django comes with an optional "flatpages" application. It lets you store simple
"flat" HTML content in a database and handles the management for you.

A flatpage is a simple object with a URL, title and content. Use it for
one-off, special-case pages, such as "About" or "Privacy Policy" pages, that
you want to store in a database but for which you don't want to develop a
custom Django application.

A flatpage can use a custom template or a default, systemwide flatpage
template. It can be associated with one, or multiple, sites.

Here are some examples of flatpages on Django-powered sites:

Installation
============

To install the flatpages app, follow these steps:

    1. Add ``"django.contrib.flatpages"`` to your INSTALLED_APPS_ setting.
    2. Add ``"django.contrib.flatpages.middleware.FlatpageFallbackMiddleware"``
       to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES_ setting.
    3. Run the command ``django-admin.py install flatpages``.

.. _MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES: http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/settings/#middleware-classes

How it works
============

``django-admin.py install flatpages`` creates two tables in your database:
``django_flatpages`` and ``django_flatpages_sites``. ``django_flatpages`` is a
simple lookup table that essentially maps a URL to a title and bunch of text
content. ``django_flatpages_sites`` associates a flatpage with a site.

The ``FlatpageFallbackMiddleware`` does all of the work. Each time any Django
application raises a 404 error, this middleware checks the flatpages database
for the requested URL as a last resort. Specifically, it checks for a flatpage
with the given URL with a site ID that corresponds to the SITE_ID_ setting.

If it finds a match, it follows this algorithm:

    * If the flatpage has a custom template, it loads that template. Otherwise,
      it loads the template ``flatpages/default``.
    * It passes that template a single context variable, ``flatpage``, which is
      the flatpage object. It uses DjangoContext_ in rendering the template.

If it doesn't find a match, the request continues to be processed as usual.

The middleware only gets activated for 404s -- not for 500s or responses of any
other status code.

Note that the order of ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` matters. Generally, you can put
``FlatpageFallbackMiddleware`` at the end of the list, because it's a last
resort.

How to add, change and delete flatpages
=======================================

Via the admin interface
-----------------------

If you've activated the automatic Django admin interface, you should see a
"Flatpages" section on the admin index page. Edit flatpages as you edit any
other object in the system.

Via the Python API
------------------

Flatpages are represented by a standard `Django model`_, which lives in
`django/contrib/flatpages/models/flatpages.py`_. You can access flatpage
objects via the `Django database API`_.

.. _Django model: http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model_api/
.. _django/contrib/flatpages/models/flatpages.py: http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/flatpages/models/flatpages.py
.. _Django database API: http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/db_api/

Flatpage templates
==================

By default, flatpages are rendered via the template ``flatpages/default``, but
you can override that for a particular flatpage.

Creating the ``flatpages/default`` template is your responsibility; in your
template directory, just create a ``flatpages`` directory containing a file
``default.html``.

Flatpage templates are passed a single context variable, ``flatpage``, which is
the flatpage object.

Here's a sample ``flatpages/default`` template::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>{{ flatpage.title }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    {{ flatpage.content }}
    </body>
    </html>
