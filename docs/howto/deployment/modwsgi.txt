How to use Django with Apache and mod_wsgi
==========================================

Deploying Django with Apache_ and `mod_wsgi`_ is the recommended way to get
Django into production.

.. _Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/
.. _mod_wsgi: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/

mod_wsgi is an Apache module which can be used to host any Python application
which supports the `Python WSGI interface`_, including Django. Django will work
with any version of Apache which supports mod_wsgi.

.. _python wsgi interface: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/

The `official mod_wsgi documentation`_ is fantastic; it's your source for all
the details about how to use mod_wsgi. You'll probably want to start with the
`installation and configuration documentation`_.

Basic Configuration
===================

Once you've got mod_wsgi installed and activated, edit your ``httpd.conf`` file
and add::

    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/mysite/apache/django.wsgi

The first bit above is the url you want to be serving your application at (``/``
indicates the root url), and the second is the location of a "WSGI file" -- see
below -- on your system, usually inside of your project. This tells Apache
to serve any request below the given URL using the WSGI application defined by that file.

Next we'll need to actually create this WSGI application, so create the file
mentioned in the second part of ``WSGIScriptAlias`` and add::

    import os
    import sys

    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'

    import django.core.handlers.wsgi
    application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

If your project is not on your ``PYTHONPATH`` by default you can add::

    sys.path.append('/usr/local/django')

just above the final ``import`` line to place your project on the path. Remember to
replace 'mysite.settings' with your correct settings file, and '/usr/local/django'
with your own project's location.

See the :ref:`Apache/mod_python documentation<howto-deployment-modpython>` for 
directions on serving static media, and the `mod_wsgi documentation`_ for an 
explanation of other directives and configuration options you can use.

For more details, see the `mod_wsgi documentation`_, which explains the above in
more detail, and walks through all the various options you've got when deploying
under mod_wsgi.
