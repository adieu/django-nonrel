How to install Django
=====================

This document will get you up and running with Django.

Install Apache and mod_python
=============================

Currently, Django runs on Apache_ with `mod_python`_. mod_python is similar to
mod_perl -- it embeds Python within Apache and loads Python code into memory
when the server starts. Code stays in memory throughout the life of an Apache
process, which leads to significant performance gains over CGI.

If you can't use mod_python for some reason, fear not: We're planning full WSGI_
support, which means Django will run on a variety of server platforms.

For the time being, make sure you have Apache installed, with the mod_python
module activated.

Get your database running
=========================

If you plan to use Django's database API functionality, you'll need to
make sure a database server is running. Django works with PostgreSQL_
(recommended) or MySQL_.

Note that MySQL support is a recent development, and Django hasn't been
comprehensively tested with that database. If you find any bugs in Django's
MySQL bindings, please file them in the `Django ticket system`_ so we can fix them
immediately.


Additionally, you'll need to make sure your Python database bindings are
installed. If you're using PostgreSQL, you'll need the psycopg_
package (version 1 -- not version 2, which is still in beta). If you're using
MySQL, you'll need MySQLdb_.

Install the Django code
=======================

Installation instructions are slightly different depending on whether you're
using the latest official version or the latest development version.

It's easy either way.

Installing the official version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the tarball of the latest official version from our `download page`_.
2. ``tar xzvf django-1.0.0.tar.gz``
3. ``cd django-1.0.0``
4. ``python setup.py install``

Installing the development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make sure you have Subversion_ installed.
2. ``svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django_src``
3. Symlink ``django_src/django`` so that ``django`` is within your Python
   ``site-packages`` directory:

   ``ln -s `pwd`/django_src/django /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/django``

   (In the above line, change ``python2.3`` to match your current Python version.)

When you want to update your code, just run the command ``svn update`` from
within the ``django_src`` directory.
