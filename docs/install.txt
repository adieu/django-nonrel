How to install Django
=====================

This document will get you up and running with Django.

Install Python
==============

Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python.

It works with any Python version 2.3 and higher.

Get Python at www.python.org. If you're running Linux or Mac OS X, you probably
already have it installed.

Install Apache and mod_python
=============================

If you just want to experiment with Django, skip this step. Django comes with
its own Web server for development purposes.

If you want to use Django on a production site, use Apache with `mod_python`_.
mod_python is similar to mod_perl -- it embeds Python within Apache and loads
Python code into memory when the server starts. Code stays in memory throughout
the life of an Apache process, which leads to significant performance gains
over other server arrangements. Make sure you have Apache installed, with the
mod_python module activated. Django requires Apache 2.x and mod_python 3.x.

See `How to use Django with mod_python`_ for information on how to configure
mod_python once you have it installed.

If you can't use mod_python for some reason, fear not: Django follows the WSGI_
spec, which allows it to run on a variety of server platforms. See the
`server-arrangements wiki page`_ for specific installation instructions for
each platform.

Get your database running
=========================

If you plan to use Django's database API functionality, you'll need to
make sure a database server is running. Django works with PostgreSQL_
(recommended), MySQL_ and SQLite_.

Additionally, you'll need to make sure your Python database bindings are
installed.

* If you're using PostgreSQL, you'll need the psycopg_ package (version 1.1 --
  not version 1.0 or version 2, which is still in beta). If you're on Windows,
  check out the unofficial `compiled Windows version`_.
* If you're using MySQL, you'll need MySQLdb_.
* If you're using SQLite, you'll need pysqlite_. Use version 2.0.3 or higher.

Install the Django code
=======================

Installation instructions are slightly different depending on whether you're
using the latest official version or the latest development version.

It's easy either way.

Installing the official version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download Django-0.91.tar.gz from our `download page`_.
2. ``tar xzvf Django-0.91.tar.gz``
3. ``cd Django-0.91``
4. ``sudo python setup.py install``

Note that the last command will automatically download and install setuptools_
if you don't already have it installed. This requires a working Internet
connection.

This will install Django in your Python installation's ``site-packages``
directory.

.. note::

    Due to recent backwards-incompatible changes, it is strongly recommended
    that you use the development version (below) for any new applications or
    if you are just starting to work with Django. The 0.91 release is a
    dead-end branch that is primarily of use for supporting legacy Django
    applications.

Installing the development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make sure you have Subversion_ installed.
2. ``svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django_src``
3. Symlink ``django_src/django`` so that ``django`` is within your Python
   ``site-packages`` directory:

   ``ln -s `pwd`/django_src/django /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/django``

   (In the above line, change ``python2.3`` to match your current Python version.)

You don't have to run ``python setup.py install``.

When you want to update your code, just run the command ``svn update`` from
within the ``django_src`` directory.
