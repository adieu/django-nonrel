Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Django, you'll need to get it installed. We have a
:ref:`complete installation guide <topics-install>` that covers all the
possibilities; this guide will guide you to a simple, minimal installation
that'll work while you walk through the introduction.

Install Python
--------------

Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python. It works with any Python
version 2.3 and higher, but we recommend installing Python 2.5 or later. If you do so, you won't need to set up a database just yet: Python 2.5 or later includes a lightweight database called SQLite_.

.. _sqlite: http://sqlite.org/

Get Python at http://www.python.org. If you're running Linux or Mac OS X, you
probably already have it installed.

.. admonition:: Django on Jython

    If you use Jython_ (a Python implementation for the Java platform), you'll
    need to follow a few additional steps. See :ref:`howto-jython` for details.

.. _jython: http://jython.org/

You can verify that Python's installed by typing ``python`` from your shell; you should see something like::

    Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17) 
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    
Set up a database
-----------------

If you installed Python 2.5 or later, you can skip this step for now.

If not, or if you'd like to work with a "large" database engine like PostgreSQL,
MySQL, or Oracle, consult the :ref:`database installation information
<database-installation>`.

Remove any old versions of Django
---------------------------------

If you are upgrading your installation of Django from a previous version, you
will need to :ref:`uninstall the old Django version before installing the new
version <removing-old-versions-of-django>`.

Install Django
--------------

You've got three easy options to install Django:

    * Install a version of Django :ref:`provided by your operating system
      distribution <misc-distributions>`. This is the quickest option for those
      who have operating systems that distribute Django.

    * :ref:`Install an official release <installing-official-release>`. This
      is the best approach for users who want a stable version number and aren't
      concerned about running a slightly older version of Django.
      
    * :ref:`Install the latest development version
      <installing-development-version>`. This is best for users who want the
      latest-and-greatest features and aren't afraid of running brand-new code.
      
.. warning::

    If do either of the first two steps, keep an eye out for parts of the
    documentation marked **new in development version**. That phrase flags
    features that are only available in development versions of Django; if you
    try to use them with an official release they won't work.
    
That's it!

That's it -- you can now :ref:`move onto the tutorial <intro-tutorial01>`.
