==========================
The "local flavor" add-ons
==========================

Following its "batteries included" philosophy, Django comes with assorted
pieces of code that are useful for particular countries or cultures. These are
called the "local flavor" add-ons and live in the ``django.contrib.localflavor``
package.

Inside that package, country- or culture-specific code is organized into
subpackages, named using `ISO 3166 country codes`_.

Most of the ``localflavor`` add-ons are localized form components deriving from
the forms_ framework -- for example, a ``USStateField`` that knows how to
validate U.S. state abbreviations, and a ``FISocialSecurityNumber`` that knows
how to validate Finnish social security numbers.

To use one of these localized components, just import the relevant subpackage.
For example, here's how you can create a form with a field representing a
French telephone number::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor import fr

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_french_phone_no = fr.forms.FRPhoneNumberField()

Supported countries
===================

Countries currently supported by ``localflavor`` are:

    * Argentina_
    * Australia_
    * Austria_
    * Brazil_
    * Canada_
    * Chile_
    * Finland_
    * France_
    * Germany_
    * Holland_
    * Iceland_
    * India_
    * Italy_
    * Japan_
    * Mexico_
    * Norway_
    * Peru_
    * Poland_
    * Romania_
    * Slovakia_
    * `South Africa`_
    * Spain_
    * Switzerland_
    * `United Kingdom`_
    * `United States of America`_

The ``localflavor`` package also includes a ``generic`` subpackage, containing
useful code that is not specific to one particular country or culture.
Currently, it defines date and datetime input fields based on those from
forms_, but with non-US default formats. Here's an example of how to use
them::

    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.localflavor import generic

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_date_field = generic.forms.DateField()

Adding flavors
==============

We'd love to add more of these to Django, so please `create a ticket`_ with
any code you'd like to contribute. One thing we ask is that you please use
Unicode objects (``u'mystring'``) for strings, rather than setting the encoding
in the file. See any of the existing flavors for examples.
