How to use Django with mod_python
=================================

Apache/mod_python currently is the preferred setup for using Django on a
production server.

mod_python, available at http://www.modpython.org/ , is similar to
`mod_perl`_ : It embeds Python within Apache and loads Python code into memory
when the server starts. Code stays in memory throughout the life of an Apache
process, which leads to significant performance gains over other server
arrangements.

To configure Django with mod_python, first make sure you have Apache installed,
with the mod_python module activated.

Then edit your ``httpd.conf`` file and add the following::

    <Location "/mysite/">
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
        SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE myproject.settings.main
        PythonDebug On
    </Location>

...and replace ``myproject.settings.main`` with the path to your settings file,
in dotted-package syntax.

This tells Apache: "Use mod_python for any URL at or under '/mysite/', using the
Django mod_python handler." It passes the value of ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``
so mod_python knows which settings to use.

Also, if you've manually altered your ``PYTHONPATH`` to put your Django project
on it, you'll need to tell mod_python::

    PythonPath "['/path/to/project'] + sys.path"

You can also add directives such as ``PythonAutoReload Off`` for performance.
See the `mod_python documentation`_ for a full list of options.

Restart Apache, and any request to /mysite/ or below will be served by Django.
Note that Django's URLconfs won't trim the "/mysite/" -- they get passed the
full URL.

When deploying Django sites on mod_python, you'll need to restart Apache each
time you make changes to your Python code.

Here's a template for an admin configuration::

    <Location "/admin/">
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
        SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE myproject.settings.admin
        PythonDebug On
    </Location>

The only thing different here is the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.
