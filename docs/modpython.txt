How to use Django with mod_python
=================================

Apache/mod_python currently is the preferred setup for using Django on a
production server.

mod_python, available at http://www.modpython.org/ , is similar to mod_perl: It
embeds Python within Apache and loads Python code into memory when the server
starts. Code stays in memory throughout the life of an Apache process, which
leads to significant performance gains over other server arrangements.

To configure Django with mod_python, first make sure you have Apache installed,
with the mod_python module activated.

Then edit your ``httpd.conf`` file and add the following::

    <Location "/mysite/">
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
        SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE myproject.settings.main
        PythonDebug On
    </Location>

...and replace ``myproject.settings.main`` with the path to your settings file,
in dotted-package syntax.

Restart Apache, and any request to /mysite/ or below will be served by Django.
Note that Django's URLconfs won't trim the "/mysite/" -- they get passed the
full URL.

Here's a template for an admin configuration::

    <Location "/admin/">
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
        SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE myproject.settings.admin
        PythonDebug On
    </Location>

The only thing different here is the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.
