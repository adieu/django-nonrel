Migrating from "oldforms" to "newforms"
=======================================

:mod:`django.newforms` is new in Django's 0.96 release, but, as it won't be new
forever. We plan to rename it to ``django.forms`` in next official release. The
current ``django.forms`` package will be available as ``django.oldforms`` until
Django 1.0, when we plan to remove it for good.

If you're using "old" forms -- and if you started using Django after 0.96 you're
probably not -- you need to read this document and understand this migration
plan.

    * The old forms framework (the current ``django.forms``) has been copied to
      ``django.oldforms``. Thus, you can start upgrading your code *now*,
      rather than waiting for the future backwards-incompatible change, by
      changing your import statements like this::

          from django import forms             # old
          from django import oldforms as forms # new

    * In the next Django release, we will move the current ``django.newforms``
      to ``django.forms``. This will be a backwards-incompatible change, and
      anybody who is still using the old version of ``django.forms`` at that
      time will need to change their import statements, as described in the
      previous bullet.

    * We will remove ``django.oldforms`` in Django 1.0. It will continue to be
      available from older tags in our SVN repository, but it will not be
      consider part of Django, and will not be supported..

With this in mind, we recommend you use the following import statement when
using ``django.newforms``::

    from django import newforms as forms

This way, your code can refer to the ``forms`` module, and when
``django.newforms`` is renamed to ``django.forms``, you'll only have to change
your ``import`` statements.

If you prefer "``import *``" syntax, you can do the following::

    from django.newforms import *

This will import all fields, widgets, form classes and other various utilities
into your local namespace. Some people find this convenient; others find it
too messy. The choice is yours.
