Comment settings
================

These settings configure the behavior of the comments framework:

.. setting:: COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED

COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED
---------------------

If ``True`` (default), removed comments will be excluded from comment
lists/counts (as taken from template tags). Otherwise, the template author is
responsible for some sort of a "this comment has been removed by the site staff"
message.

.. setting:: COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH

COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH
------------------

The maximum length of the comment field, in characters. Comments longer than
this will be rejected. Defaults to 3000.

.. setting:: COMENTS_APP

COMENTS_APP
-----------

The app (i.e. entry in ``INSTALLED_APPS``) responsible for all "business logic."
You can change this to provide custom comment models and forms, though this is
currently undocumented.
