File storage API
================

``Storage.exists(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``True`` if a file exists given some ``name``.

``Storage.path(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local filesystem path where the file can be opened using Python's standard
``open()``. For storage systems that aren't accessible from the local
filesystem, this will raise ``NotImplementedError`` instead.

``Storage.accessed_time(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.3

Returns a ``datetime`` object containing the last accessed time of the file.
For storage systems that aren't able to return the last accessed time, this
will raise ``NotImplementedError`` instead.

``Storage.created_time(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.3

Returns a ``datetime`` object containing the creation time of the file.
For storage systems that aren't able to return the creation time, this
will raise ``NotImplementedError`` instead.

``Storage.modified_time(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.3

Returns a ``datetime`` object containing the last modified time. For storage
systems that aren't able to return the last modified time, this will raise
``NotImplementedError`` instead.

``Storage.size(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the total size, in bytes, of the file referenced by ``name``.

``Storage.url(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the URL where the contents of the file referenced by ``name`` can be
accessed.

``Storage.open(name, mode='rb')``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opens the file given by ``name``. Note that although the returned file is
guaranteed to be a ``File`` object, it might actually be some subclass. In the
case of remote file storage this means that reading/writing could be quite slow,
so be warned.

``Storage.save(name, content)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Saves a new file using the storage system, preferably with the name specified.
If there already exists a file with this name ``name``, the storage system may
modify the filename as necessary to get a unique name. The actual name of the
stored file will be returned.

The ``content`` argument must be an instance of
:class:`django.core.files.File` or of a subclass of
:class:`~django.core.files.File`.

``Storage.delete(name)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deletes the file referenced by ``name``. This method won't raise an exception if
the file doesn't exist.
