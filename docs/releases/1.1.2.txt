Django 1.1.2 release notes â€” UNDER DEVELOPMENT
==============================================

This page documents release notes for the as-yet-unreleased Django
1.1.2. As such it is tentative and subject to change. It provides
up-to-date information for those who are following the 1.1.X branch.

This is the second "bugfix" release in the Django 1.1 series,
improving the stability and performance of the Django 1.1 codebase.

Django 1.1.2 maintains backwards compatibility with Django
1.1.0, but contain a number of fixes and other
improvements. Django 1.1.2 is a recommended upgrade for any
development or deployment currently using or targeting Django 1.1.

For full details on the new features, backwards incompatibilities, and
deprecated features in the 1.1 branch, see the :ref:`releases-1.1`.

One new feature
---------------

Ordinarily, a point release would not include new features, but in the
case of Django 1.1.2, we have made an exception to this rule. Django
1.2 (the next major release of Django) will contain a feature that
will improve protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
attacks. This feature requires the use of a new :ttag:`csrf_token`
template tag in all forms that Django renders.

To make it easier to support both 1.1.X and 1.2.X versions of Django with
the same templates, we have decided to introduce the :ttag:`csrf_token` template
tag to the 1.1.X branch. In the 1.1.X branch, :ttag:`csrf_token` does nothing -
it has no effect on templates or form processing. However, it means that the
same template will work with Django 1.2.
