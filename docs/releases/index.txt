what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

Upgrading
=========

For those upgrading to a new version of Django, you will need to check all the
backwards-incompatible changes and deprecated features for each 'final' release
from the one after your old version up to and including your new version.  The
relevant sections of the release notes are linked below below for your
convenience.

For those following trunk, the tentative release notes for the next version to
be released are also included at the bottom.  This is kept up to date with new
features and changes that you need to be aware of.
