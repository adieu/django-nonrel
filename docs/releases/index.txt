what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

    The list of `backwards-incompatible changes`_ made in the current
    development "trunk". If you're running versions of Django newer than an
    official release, you should keep track of new pieces pointed there. It's
    also fun reading if you're looking forward to new versions of Django.
