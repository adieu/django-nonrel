Performing raw SQL queries
==========================

Feel free to write custom SQL statements in custom model methods and
module-level methods. The object ``django.db.connection`` represents the
current database connection, and ``django.db.transaction`` represents the
current database transaction. To use the database connection, call
``connection.cursor()`` to get a cursor object. Then, call
``cursor.execute(sql, [params])`` to execute the SQL and ``cursor.fetchone()``
or ``cursor.fetchall()`` to return the resulting rows. After performing a data
changing operation, you should then call
``transaction.commit_unless_managed()`` to ensure your changes are committed
to the database. If your query is purely a data retrieval operation, no commit
is required. For example::

    def my_custom_sql(self):
        from django.db import connection, transaction
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        # Data modifying operation - commit required
        cursor.execute("UPDATE bar SET foo = 1 WHERE baz = %s", [self.baz])
        transaction.commit_unless_managed()

        # Data retrieval operation - no commit required
        cursor.execute("SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = %s", [self.baz])
        row = cursor.fetchone()

        return row

Transactions and raw SQL
------------------------
If you are using transaction decorators (such as ``commit_on_success``) to
wrap your views and provide transaction control, you don't have to make a
manual call to ``transaction.commit_unless_managed()`` -- you can manually
commit if you want to, but you aren't required to, since the decorator will
commit for you. However, if you don't manually commit your changes, you will
need to manually mark the transaction as dirty, using
``transaction.set_dirty()``::

    @commit_on_success
    def my_custom_sql_view(request, value):
        from django.db import connection, transaction
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        # Data modifying operation
        cursor.execute("UPDATE bar SET foo = 1 WHERE baz = %s", [value])

        # Since we modified data, mark the transaction as dirty
        transaction.set_dirty()

        # Data retrieval operation. This doesn't dirty the transaction,
        # so no call to set_dirty() is required.
        cursor.execute("SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = %s", [value])
        row = cursor.fetchone()

        return render_to_response('template.html', {'row': row})

The call to ``set_dirty()`` is made automatically when you use the Django ORM
to make data modifying database calls. However, when you use raw SQL, Django
has no way of knowing if your SQL modifies data or not. The manual call to
``set_dirty()`` ensures that Django knows that there are modifications that
must be committed.

Connections and cursors
-----------------------

``connection`` and ``cursor`` mostly implement the standard `Python DB-API`_
(except when it comes to :ref:`transaction handling <topics-db-transactions>`).
If you're not familiar with the Python DB-API, note that the SQL statement in
``cursor.execute()`` uses placeholders, ``"%s"``, rather than adding parameters
directly within the SQL. If you use this technique, the underlying database
library will automatically add quotes and escaping to your parameter(s) as
necessary. (Also note that Django expects the ``"%s"`` placeholder, *not* the
``"?"`` placeholder, which is used by the SQLite Python bindings. This is for
the sake of consistency and sanity.)

An easier option?
-----------------

A final note: If all you want to do is a custom ``WHERE`` clause, you can just
use the ``where``, ``tables`` and ``params`` arguments to the
:ref:`extra clause <extra>` in the standard queryset API.
