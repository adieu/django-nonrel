XX. Model inheritance

Model inheritance exists in two varieties:
    - abstract base classes which are a way of specifying common
      information inherited by the subclasses. They don't exist as a separate
      model.
    - non-abstract base classes (the default), which are models in their own
      right with their own database tables and everything. Their subclasses
      have references back to them, created automatically.

Both styles are demonstrated here.
