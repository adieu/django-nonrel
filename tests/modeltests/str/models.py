2. Adding __str__() or __unicode__() to models

Although it's not a strict requirement, each model should have a
``_str__()`` or ``__unicode__()`` method to return a "human-readable"
representation of the object. Do this not only for your own sanity when dealing
with the interactive prompt, but also because objects' representations are used
throughout Django's automatically-generated admin.

Normally,  you should write ``__unicode__()`` method, since this will work for
all field types (and Django will automatically provide an appropriate
``__str__()`` method). However, you can write a ``__str__()`` method directly,
if you prefer. You must be careful to encode the results correctly, though.
