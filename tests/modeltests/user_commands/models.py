37. User-registered management commands

The manage.py utility provides a number of useful commands for managing a
Django project. If you want to add a utility command of your own, you can.

The user-defined command 'dance' is defined in the management/commands 
subdirectory of this test application. It is a simple command that responds 
with a printed message when invoked.

For more details on how to define your own manage.py commands, look at the
django.core.management.commands directory. This directory contains the
definitions for the base Django manage.py commands.
