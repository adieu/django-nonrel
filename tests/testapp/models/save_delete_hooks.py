13. Adding hooks before/after saving and deleting

Django provides hooks for executing arbitrary code around ``save()`` and
``delete()``. Just add any of the following methods to your model:

    * ``_pre_save()`` is called before an object is saved.
    * ``_post_save()`` is called after an object is saved.
    * ``_pre_delete()`` is called before an object is deleted.
    * ``_post_delete()`` is called after an object is deleted.
